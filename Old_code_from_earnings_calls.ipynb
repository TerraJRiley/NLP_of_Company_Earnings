       " 'Michel Varaldo, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale. Two question for me. So first one it is retailer sales. We have a trend, which is still positive but declining year-by-year. And we have the negative figures in Italy, in Scandinavian countries. Is it because we have a [indiscernible] kind of cannibalization from the sales in your shopping centers through internet sales? Is it possible to have a little more color about this? And the second question is about the investment market. We have a lower activity last year, how is it in the beginning of this year in term of acquisition, disposal? Will you continue to sell at the same level for this year, for example? Thank you.',\n",
       " 'Jean-Marc Jestin',\n",
       " 'Thank you, Michel. So, the retailer sales, I donât have any crystal ball to look in the future, but the way we look at it is, first of all, I we are active in 12 countries, and then the as you know, the macro economies are never synchronized. So, and the most important element in that influence retailer sales is the GDP loss and the translation into the consumption. So, we see the slowdown of the economy at the end of â18 as one element for the lukewarm retailer service in some of the countries. But now if we want to be specific, I think Italy, this is probably a combination of many elements. Our Italian colleagues keep claiming that the climate was very unfavorable, but thatâs never an excuse. But this has been a very difficult year for the fashion retailers. And as in Italy, we are just starting reducing the fashion segment in our malls. We still have a significant exposure of fashion compared to the rest of our portfolio. So just as a number, the we have more than 42% fashion retailers in our Italian malls, while in France itâs more 35%. So, we still have a significant exposure. I donât know if significant is the right term but we have a much larger exposure. And if you look at the segment of fashion in Italy, it decreased by something like 5%, while for the group it decreased by 1%. So, I think the dynamic is to continue re-leasing to less to more to less fashion and more a dynamic segment. So, I think this is undergoing in Italy. When you look at the performance of Italy NRI-wise, itâs excellent and the reversion is also excellent. So, and the occupancy cost ratio for Italy is also pretty low. When it comes to Scandinavia, Norway has been the growth of the GDP growth of Norway significantly reduced compared to the previous years. The same in Denmark where it was almost divided by 2 compared to 2017, still positive, but kind of slowed down. So, if you have some kind of memory, you will see that the retailer sales in â14, â15, and â16, in Scandinavia were excellent. And then after a few years of GDP growth, itâs not abnormal to see a plateau in terms of sales. And Norway, more specifically, we have some malls, which are on the East Coast of Norway, which has been impacted by the oil price decrease and more unemployment. Even though, the unemployment rate in Norway is below 3%. So, at the end of the day, it will be too long to comment country-by-country, region-by-region, city-by-city, catchment the way we see our business going forward for the retailer sales, I think the we have the competition coming from the from online for our retailers, itâs of use. Itâs growing in each and every country, and itâs going to continue like this. So, we think that the segment of the shopping centers which is only 25% of the retailers, volume in Continental Europe, while in the U.S. itâs a little bit the opposite. I think the shopping center segment will be the winning format in the next 10 years. I think the as you can see in the small cities, secondary retail, high street retail is shrinking massively.',\n",
       " 'And then when I look at the malls we own and some of our peers, I have to say, that the occupancy and the demand is still very high. And I think we are going to benefit in the future in that everything equal to repatriation of the sales of the shops, which are going to use close. In each and every catchment area where we are, we are seeing shops closing. And our strategy to work with the retailers so that they invest their money in our stores to make them more appealing and when they close other stores, I think this is a winning strategy for the next 5 to 10 years. And thatâs the way we see the sales to evolve, even though, the global environment in retailer sales is almost slightly positive.',\n",

       " 'My name is [indiscernible]. You have mentioned on page 45, in the highlights you spoke about the French retailers, the plus 0.6% positive number, which is not bad, which is quite close to your European average. Would you be able to precisely quantify the impact of the 2 months of the yellow vest movement, which had a big hit, negative hit on the Christmas season to restate its impact on the 2018 full year figures? Well, yes, we know 2.2% is the negative impact of the yellow west movement of the social and rest. I will speak English?',\n",

       " 'So, the impact was 2.2% on the French we the impact of the yellow vest was November and December, not full November, not full December. So, and approximately 15% to 20% of our malls have been impacted because the movement were not national and the impact was mainly on Saturdays. So, some of the Saturdays were very bad, but most of the consumption has been transferred to other days of the week. So, the impact is pretty limited, even though, at some Saturdays it was significant. So, 2.2%. And at the end of October for the French portfolio, the retailers, sales were up by 1.5%.',\n",

       " 'Sander Bunck',\n",
       " 'Hi good morning guys. Thanks very much for presentation and two questions for me, please. I think both pretty much in capital allocation. And the first one is on your, the buyback first, the de-leveraging strategy and how are you looking there at that going forward? Do you expect to continue to do this buyback and renew this basically every year or would it be a good idea to reduce leverage further as well, i.e. from the current 35% to 40%, bring the target for example lower to say the 30% to 40% range? Thatâs the first question.',\n",
       " 'Jean-Michel Rene Gault',\n",
       " 'Okay. Maybe I take that one on the buyback. Just to say first, I hope not forever because you know there is at least one crucial parameter before the buyback, which is the share price compared to the NAV. So, I donât hope that the share price will remain forever below the NAV. So, I still have some hope there. The second thing is that for the time being this is the case, and we have always stressed that the buyback will come in connection with disposals in order to manage the expected deletion from the disposal. I think, [indiscernible] with an objective, which is still available for KlÃ©pierre to keep that stable if not lower. So, this is it. We will see going forward how it will be. For this year, what we have announced, as you know, is the â¬400 million new share buyback program in consideration of the disposal of the year that we are quite confident we will achieve during the year and we will adapt the pace of the buyback in connection with that.',\n",
       " 'Sander Bunck',\n",
       " 'Okay, thank you. And then the second one is on the quantum of the buyback. I think you said itâs around â¬400 million this year, and that you will match that with ongoing disposals. I read that as youâre looking dispose around â¬400 million worth of assets this year. And is that a right assumption or should we expect more disposals like weâve seen over the last couple of years?',\n",
       " 'Jean-Michel Rene Gault',\n",
       " 'Well, your assumption will be correct if the yield on the buyback would be the same as the disposal yield actually which is probably not the case, due to the level of the share price of today.',\n",
       " 'Sander Bunck',\n",
       " 'No, I mean, just more on in terms of the quantum of the disposals because I think you said in the statement you said you will match the disposals with the buyback?',\n",
       " 'Jean-Michel Rene Gault',\n",
       " 'No, thatâs what Iâm saying. But letâs put it otherwise. No, the idea as you know, we are not used to disclose on the disposal target, we donât have any financial constraint, but the fact is that the way we have derived the guidance is considering that the impact the remaining impact of the disposal of 2018, and the one we are going to do in 2019, will be offset by the buyback. And we have a perfect match in the way, we have sized the buyback.',\n",
       " 'Jean-Marc Jestin',\n",
       " 'I think itâs yes. And so, I think itâs important to understand that we were a net seller year. So, we are probably between not probably, we are between â¬0.02, â¬0.03 dilutive impact in â19 of the disposal will be adapted to the disposals and not the disposals to the buyback. So, the buyback is one of our tool, to manage our balance sheet and to size opportunity to create value for our shareholders. But the budget has been done with a neutral effect.',\n",
       " 'Jean-Michel Rene Gault',\n",

       " 'So, Pierre-Emmanuel Clouard from Kepler Cheuvreux. The first one just to come back on disposals. So, letâs assume that the total amount is approximately the same in 2019 from that of 2018. Can you give us a broad geographical breakdown? And maybe, are you planning given the lack of current action in the French market to sell some assets in France? The second one on your capital allocation. So, you are communicating more and more on the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, do you have a midterm target in mind for this ratio? And the third one on the value adjustments, especially in France, do you expect any value adjustment to come for your second-highest assets in France? Thank you.',\n",
       " 'Jean-Marc Jestin',\n",
       " 'For so for disposal, if we donât have a target, we donât have a geographical target. So, but so, KlÃ©pierre, itâs more than 100 shopping mall, but the top 100 in values represent 93% or 94% of our portfolio. So, what we consider as a source of non-core or assets disposals, thatâs the 7% or 6% of our portfolio. And this is what we are doing, and we are committed to streamline the portfolios that way. So, we will size any opportunity when it comes to acquisitions, disposals, share buyback in the only view to improve the quality of the portfolio and to create value for our shareholders. And we are not granular in the guidance when it comes to disposals. And as you can see, we do that in many, many regions. The net debt to EBITDA, we keep a close watch on it. Okay, as you can see on the graph. We are very proud of what we have done. So, there is no chance that we change our mind.',\n",

       " 'Yes, hi good morning. I have two questions. The first one is on CapEx. So, thank you for the additional disclosure. You mentioned â¬127 million of like-for-like maintenance CapEx, and about a quarter is recharged to tenants. So, I was just under the impression that in the past you seeing larger portion was recharged to tenant but I may be completely wrong. So obviously, it evolving the total amount, so thatâs about 0.5% of asset value as the like-for-like CapEx and the KlÃ©pierre bond by the tenant. So here itâs above 1/3. And the second question is on the yield. So basically, itâs in the market where youâre doing the best operationally, where you actually are experiencing most yield expansion, so EspaÃ±a Sl. And you actually said on the call that the SI and EspaÃ±a, in particular are at more active transaction market because of smaller size products. So, my question was, is that the markets will the transaction evidence that the yields are increasing? And where you donât have the transaction, if you donât but increase has been little longer change? Thank you.',\n",
       " 'Jean-Marc Jestin',\n",
       " 'Thank you, Charles. I like your French accent like mine. So, I was in room there this morning it was tough for my accent. So, on the CapEx, I appreciate you acknowledge that we are more transparent, we have always been very transparent. So, we have 3 elements in the CapEx. We have the maintenance CapEx and itâs most of it is recharged to the tenants. Then we have CapEx, which are associated to leasing actions that are all of them are for KlÃ©pierre and under different charts to the tenants by definition. And then we have refurbishment CapEx, and refurbishment CapEx are also partly recharged to the tenants. So, the average of one-third, itâs when you exclude the CapEx, the leasing CapEx and you only take the maintenance and the refurbishment, then you will probably come to the number you have in mind when we previously discussed of how much we recharge in maintenance and refurbishment CapEx, which is closer to 50%. So, for the yields, Iâm not sure I have there is the narrative on retail itâs is not very favorable. So, there is a lot of question about the investment market, direct investment market in the retail properties. Iâm just going to tell what we are doing. So, we have always had a strategy to have a clear gap in terms of yields between our prime properties and more secondary properties, and this is not new, itâs not something that we just have started to do. And so we are â we have always been confident and when we come to the market for the non-core assets, we meet the market, and thatâs what we are doing. So, and itâs good for us. So, when it comes to the non â to the core assets, we are not selling them, so I canât say. We see the appraisers being more cautious about retail and thatâs the reason why we see the media kind of expansion of the yields and thatâs it. Thatâs we cannot comment more on the future.',\n",

Every time we were in competition to buy some assets like the big ones that have been sold in â18, we always lost. And we always lost the competition at prices which are below our yields in our EPRA in our books. So, I think the market is also â we have to take into account that there is not so many transaction this year, but the year before of large shopping centers of a nature that is similar to what we own. So â and thatâs probably where the market has to differentiate more between the high-quality assets and secondary assets.',\n",

So, how much is energy cost in percentage of revenue, and how do you prepare for future energy price increase? Wow, so on top of my head, sir, this is a â we â the service charge represent half that we pass to the tenants, itâs approximately 20%, 25% of our revenues.',\n",

So, the increase of energy has been significant over the last years and itâ something that is going to go. So, we develop more and more green energy to get better prices, but also we have mutualized all our platforms to buy cheaper electricity depending on the legal constraints. So, we have been able to keep the service charges for â in the same level of services within energy cost which is going.

And all of them are investments in our properties, large properties, a little bit everywhere in Europe. So, we are very confident that they are reasonable extensions that they make sense, that we can lease them out and that we can control the construction cost to meet the target, which is always around 7% as a whole.

      "['Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Vocera Communications Conference Call. My name is Chris and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for todayâs call, Sue Dooley, Voceraâs Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.', 'Hello, everyone. Welcome to Voceraâs conference call to discuss our fourth quarter fiscal 2018 earnings. This is Sue Dooley. And joining me today are Voceraâs CEO, Brent Lang and our CFO, Justin Spencer.', 'We distributed a press release detailing our quarterly results earlier this afternoon. The release is posted on our website at investors.vocera.com and is also available from normal news sources. This conference call is being webcast live on the IR page of our website where a replay will be archived.', 'Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding projected operating results and anticipated market opportunities. This forward-looking information is subject to the risks and uncertainties described in Voceraâs filings with the SEC and actual results or events may differ materially. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements. On this call, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in our posted earnings release.', 'Thanks, Sue. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. On todayâs call, I will start by summarizing the highlights from the year and the fourth quarter. Then I will provide some details on key customer wins, some specifics on bookings in each area of our business and an update on some strategic deployments that occurred in the quarter. I will conclude my prepared remarks with commentary on the market environments and our priorities for 2019 before turning the call over to Justin for more details on our financials.', '2018 produced record revenue and enhanced profitability, tremendous progress winning large enterprise accounts, significant expansions of our solution within existing customers and another good year in the federal space. We added a record number of new healthcare facilities during 2018 which is a strong leading indicator of future growth. We also made significant progress with our large customer deployments and maintained very high customer satisfaction as reflected by both our maintenance renewal and customer surveys.', 'Another highlight was the completion of our Smartbadge, a new unprecedented advancement in product innovation for Vocera. The completeness of our solution remains a differentiator for us and customer desire for collaboration solutions and their need to mobilize data drove our business this year. We have validated our leadership position with several large customer wins and our solution continues to succeed against competitors. As we begin 2019, Iâm excited by our large market opportunities, the increasing differentiation of our unified solutions, and our pipeline of large deals.', 'Fourth quarter revenue was $49 million, up 11% over the same period last year, bringing revenue for the year to $180 million, an 8% increase over 2017. Full year bookings were $181 million, up 9% over last year. Despite a strong booking performance through the first three quarters of the year, we saw mixed results in our bookings in Q4. We had great success with some large strategic wins and strong software bookings. However, our federal and international bookings fell short of our expectations for Q4. We also saw decline in device bookings after record device bookings in Q2 and Q3. We attribute this to two factors. First, our bookings in the fed are particularly badge-heavy and second we believe that despite our best efforts to keep it a secret, news of the coming Smartbadge may have gotten out negatively impacting Q4 device bookings.', 'Highlights for the fourth quarter included 3 large wins at Northwestern Medicine, Albany Medical Center and a very large hospital system in the Middle East. Our progress in cultivating and harvesting our pipeline of large deals continues to be a bright spot for our business. The large deals closed in the fourth quarter showcase our extensive market appeal, differentiated offering and solid sales execution in our strategic accounts.', 'The highlight of the quarter was an impressive $6 million enterprise-wide win at Northwestern Medicine, which will be deploying our complete solution for physicians and other clinicians and integrating it with Epic. We also won a $2.9 million deal at Albany Medical Center in New York, where they will utilize our solution extensively, including multiple integrations across 55 departments. In the Middle East, we were pleased to win a large and strategic booking at a leading hospital system. In this $4 million booking, one of the regionâs premier healthcare providers will initially deploy our engaged software on an enterprise level across 11 hospitals. We see significant potential for future cross-sell opportunities within the system and we believe this win augments our leadership in the region.', 'Another important part of our business is expanding our solution to new departments and users at existing customers. One notable expansion was CHRISTUS Health in Texas where we are steadily expanding Healthwise into existing facilities and into new construction. Our value proposition matches the strategic goals of CHRISTUS resulting in Vocera becoming the enterprise standard. We also had significant expansions of our existing footprint at Adena Health and Methodist Hospital. While 2018 was another strong year for our federal business, Q4 government bookings were not as high as we had hoped due to the timing of specific federal purchases that we planned to close at the end of the quarter, prior to the government shutdown. Overall, we remain very optimistic about the large opportunity for both new customer wins and expansions within the federal space, because we are their de facto standard for hospital communications. We believe improved clinical communication and effective OR management are initiatives with rising importance in the DOD and the VA hospitals.', 'On the international front, with the big win I mentioned earlier in the Middle East, our international business finished a strong year, reflecting our continued focus on improving our operations overseas. However, we had varied result in Q4 across the region with Canada, Australia and New Zealand down in Q4 compared to last year, while the UK and the Middle East were up substantially. International remains a big opportunity and a top priority for us. Itâs an emerging part of our business and as we have previously stated will be lumpy from time-to-time. We are investing in the sales teams and marketing support to drive growth in these regions. Finally, our non-healthcare business had a good year. We achieved several strategic wins in the hospitality space where our brand is becoming well established. This quarter we signed a deal with the new Four Seasons MontrÃ©al, our 11th Four Seasons property. We are delighted to continue to help with this world-class brand deliver its renowned high level service.', 'Now, I would like to talk some about our successful deployments during the quarter. As we continue to book large enterprise deals, our professional services expertise remains a meaningful differentiator in helping our customers achieve their goals. The experience and efficiency of our professional services organization continues to grow, and deployments of our solutions are numerous and remain on schedule. For example, the first go live at Hoag Hospital occurred in Q4. Youâll remember this was a large and strategic win for us several quarters ago, and a complex deployment involving numerous integrations. Hoag is using Vocera as a unifying platform to manage alerts, alarms and texts to all staff and care providers.', 'I also want to highlight a deployment that shows how our solution is compelling for hospitals of all sizes. Hardin Memorial Hospital in Kenton, Ohio went live with our solution in Q4, including several integrations, replacing their legacy technology for all of their users. This 25-bed hospital illustrates how even a small customer can leverage our solution to meet their objectives for efficiency and patient experience. Also during Q4, OhioHealth in Columbus, Ohio completed an expansion of our solution that included integration with our new partner, QGenda. A seamless integration between Vocera and QGenda eliminates the need for most end users to manually access the on-call scheduling system and paves the way for greater workflow efficiency, scalability and end-user accessibility.', 'Now, if I can talk for a moment about the market for our solution and share what we are hearing in our conversations with customers, as we begin 2019, cost savings and efficiency remain top priorities for IT spending. Customers are looking for a partner who can take a clinical approach to solving the workflow bottlenecks by mobilizing data to speed decision-making with improved context about patients and caregivers. Our unified solution combining real-time voice, secure texting and deep clinical integration is succeeding because it delivers on these challenges. While there are aspects of the market that are outside of our control, we remain focused on our opportunity.', 'Government budget uncertainty, changes to healthcare policy and reimbursement, and even the economy overall are all of concern to enterprises and to companies everywhere, and they represent dynamics we always pay careful attention to. There are also plenty of things we know for sure, like our large market opportunity, our unique competitive advantage and our own execution. Our focus continues to be on developing our pipeline of strategic accounts, engaging with customers about the powerful new Smartbadge, advancing our ROI-based selling and working to elevate our solutions as a spending priority for hospitals.', 'Regardless of what the macro environment may be in a given year, I believe that we are just getting started. We are managing the business for the long term, and we believe we are in the early stages of a market that is underserved. There is a large opportunity for us to continue to drive substantial growth in the business for years to come as we grow our footprint across the U.S. and expand internationally.', 'Now, I would like to highlight a couple of our key priorities for the coming year. In 2019, the number one priority for us is to drive our bookings growth at a mid-teens rate by winning new hospital systems and driving system-wide expansions in our existing customers. We will also continue to focus on growth from our international markets while we are building strength in our local teams. We are making focused investments internationally providing compelling ROI based case studies to our teams to help them build pipelines and we feel confident in our ability to succeed in these markets.', 'The introduction of the Smartbadge will also be a catalyst for growth. While maintaining the magic of our lightweight hands-free device, the Smartbadge is a game changer for our business, with its 2.4-inch touchscreen and enhanced features, designed to improve the workflow of the care team. Not only do I believe the Smartbadge will drive a hardware refresh, it will also drive software sales, particularly for integration and messaging licenses, as customers gain appreciation for the power of the device. With more users utilizing intelligent alerts and alarms through the Smart Badge, I believe it will drive demand for engaged software licenses over the long term. Four weeks into the launch, the striking new form factor of the wearable Smartbadges received a lot of attention from the industry. And itâs already catalyzing conversations with customers, who may have previously decided against the use of the badge. We believe the new Smartbadge will enable us to reengage with potential customers and displays legacy competitive solutions where screen size has been an inhibitor to our success.', 'On the software front, while we believe our current platform can be sold as a complete solution today, we are always looking for ways to expand our offering across the care continuum by building, buying or partnering with solutions that further enable the real-time health system. We are investing in product innovation to extend our clinical relevance both within and outside the four walls of the hospital. We are bringing to life our vision of consolidating clinical data and delivering actionable information and context to the right care team member at the right time. We hit many milestones this year, and are pleased with our progress. Itâs an exciting time for Vocera as we strive to grow the business and accelerate towards our profitability goals. I am proud of the work we have done to move closer to our target model, and Iâm excited about our future.', 'Now, I would like to give our CFO, Justin, a chance to cover the financial details around our Q4 results and our 2019 guidance. Justin?', 'Thanks, Brent. Hello, everyone. Q4 capped a off positive year overall, highlighted by continued revenue growth and significantly higher profitability in 2018. Total revenue in Q4 grew 11% to $48.9 million, driven largely by the continued expansion of our software platform. For the full year, total revenue was $179.6 million, also up from 2017. As we enter 2019, the ASC 606 transition is now behind us, and we believe future results will have better year-over-year comparability.', 'Product revenue in the quarter increased 11% to $27.2 million with very strong performance in software. Device revenue was below our expectation as we believe rumors of our new Smartbadge delayed some purchases in Q4. We believe this is a temporary issue and itâs tied to a natural enterprise product introduction cycle. We are really encouraged by the significant in interest that customers have already shown in the new Smartbadge since their launch in early January. We expect our device revenue to grow again in 2019. Our software revenue was exceptional at $11.8 million in Q4, representing growth of 41%.', 'Software revenue alone represented 24% of total revenue in the quarter, and was 21% for the full year as we continue to make progress towards the revenue mix goal in our target model. As an additional reference, software and software maintenance revenue combined, which we view holistically as our software business grew 21% in 2018, exceeding 50% of total revenue. We expect another strong year of software growth in 2019, driven by continued cross-selling and now the wearable Smartbadge. We view this new device as a vehicle to effectively deliver the power and functionality of our software platform to a broader set of users. The Smartbadge is capable of delivering the full functionality of our software platform and will likely drive the sale of additional software licenses.', 'Services revenue in the fourth quarter was $21.7 million, also up 11% from last year. Our professional services revenue was down year-over-year as we have focused on streamlining our implementation processes and driving down this cost for our customers, which has enabled us to shift more of the deal value to software. Having said that, we expect professional services to grow again in 2019 as we have a strong backlog of projects, several of which are tied to the large deals we closed in 2018.', 'The other large portion of our services portfolio is software maintenance and support, which I touched on a bit earlier. With the sizable increase in our customer base this year and a renewal rate well above 95%, our software maintenance and support revenue grew 21% in Q4 compared to last year. This revenue is all recurring and is tied directly to the enhanced value and functionality our customers have been able to receive from our software platform.', 'Now, Iâd like to comment briefly on our backlog and deferred revenue. Our combined backlog and deferred revenue at the end of the year was $120.4 million. While up only slightly from last year, Iâd like to provide some context around this number. First, we had a softer than expected device bookings quarter in Q4, and we attribute this to rumors of the new Smartbadge introduction in January. We believe our device backlog will grow by the end of 2019 as we drive bookings and revenue growth again in this category. Second, we are delivering on our goals to convert our backlog to revenue more quickly, something I talked about early last year.', 'ASC 606 has shortened the revenue recognition on software and our streamlined implementation processes have reduced the time and cost that it takes to go live with our solution. So as we look to the full year of 2019, we donât need as much backlog and deferred revenue to achieve our revenue goal as we needed going into prior years. Having said that, we always strive to build backlog and deferred revenue in conjunction with our revenue growth. On the profitability side, in Q4, we achieved adjusted EBITDA of $7.5 million.', 'For the full year, our adjusted EBITDA accrued 29% to $21.2 million, exceeding our original expectations. We drove 35% operating leverage in 2018 and continued to make good progress towards our target profitability model. Now let me get into some more detail on our non-GAAP gross margins and operating expenses.', 'Non-GAAP gross margin in Q4 exceeded 67%, driven largely by a higher mix of software and the associated software maintenance revenue. We were pleased with the product gross margin at 75%, buoyed largely by our software business. Our services gross margin increased compared to last year as we drove even more leverage in our software maintenance and technical support functions. For the year, our gross margin increased to a record of 66%, again tracking well towards our target model.', 'As we now look forward to 2019, we expect our overall non-GAAP gross margin to be similar to 2018. The gross margin on our badge is quite healthy, and we expect similar margins for the new Smartbadge. Given our expected revenue seasonality in 2019, we believe that the gross margin percentage will be in the low 60s in the first half, and then in the high 60s in the second half. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased to $25.7 million in Q4, reflecting in part the investment in R&D and marketing to support our Smartbadge launch in early January.', 'For the full year, operating expenses were $99.1 million or 55% of revenue which was down from 56% last year. We have remained very focused on becoming more efficient throughout our entire business as we scale. In the last 5 years, our operating expense to revenue ratio has declined from 77% in 2014 to 55% in 2018. And we expect this positive trend to continue in 2019 as our revenue growth rate outpaces our expense growth. In Q1 2019, we expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be around $27 million, and then should remain at that quarterly level through the rest of the year.', 'Now Iâd like to make a few comments about our cash flow and balance sheet. We added $6.2 million of cash to our balance sheet in Q4 as a result of our profitability and working capital management. For the full year, our operating cash flow was $14.3 million, and we expect this to be even higher in 2019. Following our seasonal pattern, cash flow will likely be negative in the first half of 2019 and then positive in the second half of the year. Our CapEx is expected to be around $5 million in 2019 or roughly 3% of revenue. With our balance sheet, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on new growth opportunities.', 'Turning to guidance, Brent spoke earlier about market dynamics related to the impact of government budget disputes and general uncertainty in macro environment, which we are watching carefully. In setting our guidance, we have also taken into account the Smartbadge introduction. Our guidance assumes a short-term, temporary decline in device revenue, including minimal revenue from the Smartbadge in the first half of the year. However, we expect our device revenue to grow again in the second half, fueled in large part by traction with the new Smartbadge. As a result we expect our revenue seasonality in 2019 to be more pronounced than usual, with roughly 40% of our revenue in the first half and 60% in the second half.', 'During the second half of the year, we expect our revenue growth rate to be at or even exceed mid-teens. Our profitability is tied closely to our revenue, so we expect adjusted EBITDA to be negative in Q1, and then up significantly as we move into the second half of the year. For 2019, we expect revenue to be between $187 million and $197 million. With this annual revenue growth, we also expect to improve profitability and continue towards our target model. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $22 million and $26 million in 2019, improving each quarter as the year progresses. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be between $32 million and $35 million, reflecting the impact of the lower device backlog and Smartbadge introduction I discussed earlier. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between negative $6.8 million and $4.5 million.', 'As we look back on 2018, we believe we have a lot to feel good about. We are now laser focused on a successful smart Badge ramp, along with continuing to drive our software business even higher levels. With success in these areas, we expect to exceed mid-teens growth during the second half of the year, while also delivering even higher levels of profitability and cash flow in 2019.', 'Thanks, Justin. Overall, I believe 2018 was a year of tremendous accomplishment for Vocera. Demand for our products is on the rise, and we have further extended our competitive advantage. With the introduction of Vocera Smartbadge, we redefined wearable mobile communication and expanded the opportunity for new conversations with existing and prospective customers. The functionality and scalability of our differentiated software platform is unmatched in the marketplace, and our solution provides a compelling value proposition for hospitals of all sizes. We had a truly great year for large system wins and our continued success underscores the strategic importance customers are seeing in our products. The capability of our solutions and our ROI-based sales approach are resonating with a large underserved market that is primed for growth. Our financials and balance sheet are strong and our operating model has tremendous leverage. As we transition to being increasingly software-centered, our profitability is expanding. We are well-positioned for long-term revenue growth and expanding margins. And we are excited for the year ahead.', 'Before opening up the call for questions, Iâd like to personally invite all of you to our investor breakfast at HIMSS next Wednesday. Feel free to contact Sue if you have any questions about this and please stop by our booth at HIMSS to check out the new Smartbadge and see how it showcases our expanded software capabilities. Thank you for listening today. Operator, we are ready to open up the call for questions. Thank you.']\n"
